                  <span style="color: white;"></span>The above poem was composed
                  by Private Patrick J. O'Connor, he was apart of the 25th U.S.
                  Infantry Division. He was killed in action in the attack on
                  Hill 466 on May 30, 1951. Pat was a man of poetry and had just
                  finished his poem "Korea" just the night before, little
                  knowing that he had less than 24 hours to live. The poem was
                  found among his personal effects the next day. Pat was in
                  action only five days when he was killed on May 30, 1951.<br>

                <ul>
                  <p>My take on history: This was just written days before he
                    fell in the battle for Korea. He was a poet and he only
                    lasted 5 days fighting for his country. Patrick J. O'Connor
                    while unknown to the majority of us citizens still cemented
                    a legacy for us and his wife Vera Irene, not as a fighter
                    but as a poet that was the last thing he did before rushing
                    up that Hill, Hill 466. 24 hours can make all the
                    difference, it can&nbsp; change the course of history
                    forever in wildest of ways.</p>
                  <p>He battled the bloody price of freedoms blissful touch.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p><span>He was part of the 25th Brigade serving the USA even

                      hands further taint the sacred land.</span></p>
                  <p><span>And that was his poem a poem of a legacy short lived,
                      he died at age 27, On that lone hill of 466 leaving his
                      wife widowed, and cementing him one of my favorite poets,
                      not for the words, but the context of those words, his
                      death boosts this poem to my favorite it tells the tale of
                      war so perfectly all opportunity stopped short. He could
                      have been anything in a world of uncertainty, but he
                      choose to be a fighter. <br>
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span>The more I research and read his story the more I
                      think about our freedom as a country. Our freedom is a
                      deadly one, one not taken with kindness but hope, forged
                      through the slaying of great evils. Lets not forget what
                      we stand for...<br>

                  <p><span>This page remembers who have fallen to war for our
                      freedom not just this dude but to everyone who has fallen
                      for our Republic. As a nation we need to spend more time
                      remembering what our core values are -it is one of freedom
                      no matter the cost, no matter the odds against us we will
                      prevail. Even though some may fall many will prosper and
                      have children be ignorant to how blissful our freedom is.
                      <br>
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span>Isn't that the goal of any society to have children
                      unaware by life's brutal torment? <br>
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span>To be happy no matter the situation? <br>
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span>To be free to hurt himself to learn to grow to
                      prosper? <br>
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span>He fought so we could run we completely freed half a
                      nation from its communist holders just because we looked
                      at one side and we thought it needed more freedom and less
                      totalitarian control.<br>

                      comrade under intense machine gun fire from Communist

                      Regiment. The two men were killed almost instantaneously.”<br>

                      wounded four others. Pat and his partner came running up
                      the hill to get the wounded but another burst of fire hit
                      them both. He died as he had lived, trying to aid others
