        <h2>Indexed Poem:</h2>
        There is blood on the hills of Korea <br>
        Tis the blood of the brave and true.<br>
        Where the 25th Brigade battled together<br>
        Under the banner of the Red, White and Blue.<br>
        As they marched over the fields of Korea<br>
        To the hill where the enemy lay.<br>
        They remembered the Brigadiers orders:<br>
        "These hills must be taken today."<br>
        Forward they marched into battle<br>
        With faces unsmiling and stern.<br>
        They Knew as they charged the hillside<br>
        That some would never return.<br>
        <br>
        Some thought of their wives and mothers,<br>
        Some thought of their sweethearts so fair<br>
        And some as they plodded and stumbled,<br>
        Were reverently whispering a prayer.<br>
        There is blood on the hills of Korea,<br>
        It is the gift of freedom they love,<br>
        May their names live in glory forever,<br>
        And their souls rest in heaven above.<br>
        <br>
        In the field, Korea<br>

        <span style="color: white;"></span>The above poem was composed by
        Private Patrick J. O'Connor, a stretcher bearer, Royal Canadian
        Regt. , attached to the 25th U. S. Infantry Division, who was killed
        in action in the attack on Hill 466 on May 30, 1951. Pat was a man
        of poetry and had just finished his poem "Korea" just the night
        before, little knowing that he had less than 24 hours to live. The
        poem was found among his personal effects the next day. Pat was in
        action only five days when he was killed on May 30, 1951.<br>

        <p>My take on history: This was just written days before he fell in
          the battle for Korea. He was a poet and he only lasted 5 days
          fighting for his country. Patrick J. O'Connor while unknown to the
          majority of us citizens still cemented a legacy for us and his
          wife Vera Irene,not as a fighter but as a poet that was the last
          thing he did before rushing up that Hill, Hill 466. He wrote that
          poem and only had 24 hours to live. 24 hours can make all the
          difference, it can&nbsp; change the course of history forever in
          wild ways.</p>

        <p>He battled the bloody price of freedoms blissful touch.</p>
